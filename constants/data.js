      `I'm a self-starter and community-taught software developer skilled in the MERN Stack, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with a hunger to learn more. I have a BA from Wilfrid Laurier University, originally focused in communications and digital arts, but found that I could not put down coding during the pandemic, and here I am. Outside of coding, I enjoy YouTube (looking at what's new in tech / latest gadgetry), making playlists with Tidal and Spotify, spending time with my dog, working out in the gym, walks, and cafes.`,
      `I'm looking for frontend, backend, or full-stack development roles. I'm also keen to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts for shared growth and connections. Feel free to reach out for collaborations or tech chats over coffee`,
